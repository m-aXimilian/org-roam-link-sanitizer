* Org-Roam-Link-Sanitizer
When using a latex export on an org-roam file that has links to other org-roam files (which is most likely the case since that is the point of org-roam), it will fail with an error close to this
#+begin_quote
user-error: Unable to resolve link: "4d0545c9-aea1-41da-a2fd-20a154f4f76c"
#+end_quote
where the uid is a placeholder.

Since I am using org-roam-ref, I want to have some sort of "sanitizer" functionality, that
1. looks into the link
2. decides to
   - convert the link to the roam-ref file to a "plain" org-ref like [[cite:&hawkingBlackHoleExplosions1974]] in case there is a key ~:ROAM_REFS: cite:hawkingBlackHoleExplosions1974~ in the properties of the link at hand
   - or simply discard the link at hand (probably something more sophisticated than ignoring will be due, but for now that shall be it)

** Usage
Put ~org-roam-link-sanitizer.el~ somewhere in you ~load-path~ and run the following in your configuration.
#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'org-roam-link-sanitizer)
  (add-to-list 'org-export-before-parsing-hook  #'link-sanitizer-sanitize-links-for-pdf-export)
#+end_src

Or with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/use-package.html][use-package]] (given ~org-roam-link-sanitizer.el~ is added to ~load-path~ anyway)
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-roam-link-sanitizer
    :after org-roam
    :config
    (add-to-list 'org-export-before-parsing-hook  #'link-sanitizer-sanitize-links-for-pdf-export))
#+end_src


** Installation
Clone the repository
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://codeberg.org/m-aXimilian/org-roam-link-sanitizer.git
#+end_src

Add the path to ~org-roam-link-sanitizer.el~ (lets assume it is ~/home/user/repos/org-roam-link-sanitizer/org-roam-link-sanitizer.el~) to ~load-path~ like
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/user/repos/org-roam-link-sanitizer")
#+end_src

Proceed with [[Usage][Usage]].
